## Translating Python Script to MLflow Recipe

Based on the provided script and following the guidelines you outlined, here's the breakdown of the translation into MLflow recipe (recipe.yaml) and local configuration (local.yaml) files:

**1. Recipe (recipe.yaml):**

```yaml
# Define the recipe name based on the model type (classification in this case)
name: "{{nomedellarecipe}}"  # Replace with "classification" or "regression"

# Define steps involved in the MLflow pipeline
model_training:
  # Reference the Python module containing the training logic
  module: "train_model.py"
  # Define function within the module to be executed for training
  function: "train_model"
  # Input data for the training step (reference transformed data from previous step)
  inputs:
    from_step: transform_data  # Reference output of transform_data step
  # Parameters (reference split ratios from local.yaml)
  params:
    SPLIT_RATIOS: "{{ SPLIT_RATIOS }}"

data_transform:
  # Reference the Python module containing the data transformation logic
  module: "train_model.py"
  # Define function within the module to be executed for transformation
  function: "transform_data"
  # Input data for the transformation step (reference raw data from ingest_data step)
  inputs:
    from_step: ingest_data

data_ingestion:
  # Reference the Python module containing the data ingestion logic
  module: "train_model.py"
  # Define function within the module to be executed for data ingestion
  function: "ingest_data"
  # Expected arguments for the data ingestion function (data paths)
  params:
    file_paths: "{{ DATA_PATHS }}"

# Define evaluation metrics (to be populated after training)
evaluation:
  f1_score: '{{ F1_SCORE }}'
  precision_score: '{{ PRECISION_SCORE }}'
  recall_score: '{{ RECALL_SCORE }}'

# Allow registration by default (can be overridden in local.yaml)
allow_non_validated_model: True
```

**2. Local Configuration (local.yaml):**

```yaml
# Define data paths (replace with actual file paths)
DATA_PATHS:
  - ./data/winequality-white.csv
  - ./data/winequality-red.csv

# Define split ratios for training, validation, and testing
SPLIT_RATIOS: [0.8, 0.1, 0.1]

# Thresholds for evaluation metrics (set based on your requirements)
# You can adjust these values as needed
F1_SCORE_THRESHOLD: 0.8  # Example threshold for F1 score

# Additional configuration parameters can be added here as needed
```

**Explanation:**

* The `name` in the recipe.yaml is set as a Jinja template variable `{{nomedellarecipe}}`. You can replace this with `"classification"` based on the script's functionality.
* Each step in the recipe references the corresponding Python function from the `train_model.py` script.
* Inputs and parameters for each step are clearly defined.
* The `evaluation` section is a placeholder for metrics to be logged after training.
* `allow_non_validated_model` is set to `True` by default in the recipe, allowing registration regardless of evaluation thresholds. You can override this in `local.yaml` if needed.
* The `local.yaml` file defines data paths, split ratios, and example thresholds for evaluation metrics.

**Note:**

* This is a general guideline based on the provided script. You might need to adjust the recipe and configuration based on specific functionalities in your script (e.g., additional steps, custom metrics).
* Remember to install the `Jinja2` library (`pip install Jinja2`) to use template variables in the recipe.

By following these steps and filling in the missing details (data paths and thresholds), you can translate the Python script into a well-structured MLflow recipe and local configuration for managing your machine learning workflow.
